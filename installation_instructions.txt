NIMBLE and Software Installation Instructions

1) R
Download links and instructions are available at:
https://cran.r-project.org/

2) RStudio (optional)
Download links and instructions are available at:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

3) R packages: igraph, coda, nimble
From RStudio, packages can be installed using the dropdown menu: Tools > Install Packages ...
From the R prompt, packages can be installed using:
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("coda")
install.packages("nimble")

4) C++ compiler (Windows: Rtools; Mac OSX: Xcode)

Windows: Install Rtools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).  Important: during the installation process, you'll have to check the "PATH" checkbox, allowing the installer to modify the system PATH variable, so that R can find Rtools.

Mac OSX: Install Xcode.  This is available from either the Apple Developer Site (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/), or from the Apple App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12)

5) To verify you have correctly installed the C++ compiler:

- Restart R (and Rstudio)
- Install the R package: "devtools"
- Execute the following R code:
library(devtools)
devtools::has_devel()

This final command should not produce any output.  If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, it will give an error message.
